chess
=====

Chess game, mostly for testing stuff  
  
Roadmap:  
  Finish rules regarding capturing the king.  
  Additional UI using canvas for 2d, and three.js for 3d view. option to choose between them?  
  Recode logic to work with node.js or other serverside thing to work with multiplayer. Provide a lobby and host a chess  
    playing site. Maybe provide login and rankings, but not a priority  
  Make a lot cooler features, like 3d model armies with animations and other coolness.  
    Eventually abandon chess, and use gained knowledge and experience to do something more original.
